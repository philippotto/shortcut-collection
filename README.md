shortcut-collection
===================

This is my collection of scripted shortcuts that have accumulated over the years. A lot of them use the capslock key as a modifier to avoid inconvenient movements of hands and fingers.

Download AutoHotkey to run the *.ahk files: http://ahkscript.org/download/

If you want to use the shortcuts in programs which were run as administrator, you need to start AutoHotkey as administrator, too.
